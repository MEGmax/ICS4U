        //1. It is required that overloaded methods contain different parameter lists. This is because the method
        //signature changes due to the different data types passed to the method and distinguishes itself as a seperate method
        //to run.

        //2. A method signature is the method name along with the data types of the methods parameters, in the order that they appear

        //3 "This is the second version of the method.
        //   This is the first version of the method."
